# What are Trees?
Tree is a hierarchial data structure with with the following features:

1. One root node.
2. Each node can have any number of child nodes.
3. Each node (other than the root) links to exactly one parent.

**Height** : Number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node.

**Depth** : Number of edges from that node to the tree’s root node.

## Why use Trees? 

1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy.

2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 

3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 

4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

# Binary Tree

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. 
A Binary Tree node contains following parts.

a. Data

b. Pointer to left child

c. Pointer to right child

<br />

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self,key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key

root=Node(1)

\\ To add left and right subtrees.

ltree=Node(2)
rtree=Node(3)
root.left=ltree
root.right=rtree

```

<br />

## Properties of Binary Trees

1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is **2l**. 

2. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is **2h – 1**. 

3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is **Log2(N+1)**   

4. A Binary Tree with l leaves has at least **|Log2L|+1**   levels 

5. In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

## Types of Binary Trees
<br />

### 1. FULL BINARY TREE 

A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are the examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children. 
```
               18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40

             18
           /    \   
         15     20    
        /  \       
      40    50   
    /   \
   30   50

               18
            /     \  
          40       30  
                   /  \
                 100   40
```
<br />

### 2. COMPLETE BINARY TREE

A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
```
              18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40


               18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40
     /  \   /
    8   7  9 
```
<br />

### 3. PERFECT BINARY TREE

A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
```
               18
           /       \  
         15         30  
        /  \        /  \
      40    50    100   40


               18
           /       \  
         15         30  
```
- In a Perfect Binary Tree, the number of leaf nodes is the number of internal nodes plus 1  
<br />

### 4. BALANCED BINARY TREE

A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. 

For Example, the AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is at most 1. Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the number of Black nodes on every root to leaf paths is the same and there are no adjacent red nodes. Balanced Binary Search trees are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete. 
<br />

### 5. DEGENERATE BINARY TREE

A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list. 
```
      10
      /
    20
     \
     30
      \
      40     
```
<br />

# Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

To search for a value in a BST, we need a maximum of:
* **log(n)** recursions if number of nodes is n.
* **n** recursions if height of tree is n.
